**Survey:**

I want to answer two questions: What is the best way to implement automatic image captioning, and what systems are the users of LibrePhotos using?

Fill out this questionnaire, to help me out! https://forms.gle/vJjzxwpXf5vwTm9v9

**Upstream:**

- ðŸš€ LibrePhotos: You can now download a new image captioning model called BLIP
- âœ¨ Frontend: Shared album will now be visible in URL, which allows for deep-linking. (Implemented by [sickelap](https://github.com/sickelap))
- âœ¨ Frontend: Tons of maintainability issue fixed by [sickelap](https://github.com/sickelap)
- âœ¨ LibrePhotos: Progress of downloading models is now visible in the logs
- âœ¨ LibrePhotos: Updated around a bunch of dependencies and updated language strings from the community
- ðŸ”¨ LibrePhotos: Download of pictures should work now, even if the zip file is large. Fixed by [AnkurPrabhu](https://github.com/AnkurPrabhu)
