**Upstream:**

- 🚀 LibrePhotos: Deprecated redis and redis-rq with django-q2

django-q2 will give us a lot of new possibilities. The most important one is, that the queue will actually be remembered. In the future the queue can be modified and has native options for cron jobs.

- 🚀 LibrePhotos: More settings for face detection and face clustering

There are five new settings, which you can tweak, to make it better fit your dataset. I hope that there will be a couple of people who will try out all the different settings, so that we can find better defaults :)

- 🚀 LibrePhotos: Scanning uploaded photos happens automatically when completed
- ✨ Frontend: Load top groups first in PhotoListView
