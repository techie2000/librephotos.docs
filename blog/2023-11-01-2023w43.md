**Survey:**

I want to answer two questions: What is the best way to implement automatic image captioning, and what systems are the users of LibrePhotos using?

Fill out this questionnaire, to help me out! https://forms.gle/vJjzxwpXf5vwTm9v9

**Interview:**

I did an interview with console. If you want to know more about me and the project, you can find the interview here: https://console.substack.com/p/console-180

**Upstream:**

- 🚀 LibrePhotos: Machine Learning models will now get downloaded on the first scan and saved within the protected_media folder. This reduces the size of the cpu based image by 50%, which should make updating faster.
- 🚀 LibrePhotos: You can now see the available space on the sidebar on the right!
- 🚀 Frontend: You can now filter by photo and by video (Implemented by [AnkurPrabhu](https://github.com/AnkurPrabhu))
- 🚀 LibrePhotos: ONNX is now available as an ML execution engine
- 🚀 LibrePhotos: You can now select the image caption model you want to use
- ✨ Frontend: Search query will now be visible in URL, which allows for deep-linking. (Implemented by [sickelap](https://github.com/sickelap))
- ✨ Frontend: Tons of maintainability issue fixed by [sickelap](https://github.com/sickelap)
- ✨ LibrePhotos: A lot of new and improved translations from the community
- ✨ LibrePhotos: Updated around 40 dependencies
- 🔨 LibrePhotos: Face recognition should now work on the GPU image
- 🔨 Frontend: Fixed an issue, where public photos with no timestamp breaks settings
