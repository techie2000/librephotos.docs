You can look into the issues [here](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afrontend),
on what features are missing from the frontend.

We are in the process of migrating from Redux to redux-toolkit and redux-query.

It would be also create if you could write E2E tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for the frontend.

You can also help by expanding the documentation.
