We developed our frontend with the following technologies:

- React
- Mantine
- Redux / Redux Toolkit
- Axios

## ‚ú® Code Standards

We also have here some git hooks. Please do a npm prepare and then the formatter and the linter are good to go. We use eslint and prettier to keep our code tidy

## üêõ Debugging

### React Debug Tool

React provides a debug tool, which you can download [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=de)

### Redux Debug Tool

Redux also provides a debug tool, to debug the actions and states [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=de)

### WDYR

[WDYR](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render) explains to you why a component re-rendered. To activate it, add WDYR=True to your development .env. For more detail, look up the docs.

### REST API

Our Rest API is documented with [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) and [ReDoc](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/). After you
start up LibrePhotos, you can find them under:

```
localhost:3000/api/swagger
```

```
localhost:3000/api/redoc
```

Some APIs are not yet well documented, as the generation of the swagger API throws error [Link](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos/issues/485)

## üèôÔ∏è Structure

- You can find all the routes in [App.js](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/blob/dev/src/App.js).
- The pages are in [layouts](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/tree/dev/src/layouts)
- Pages should be split up into React Components, which you can find in
  [components](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/tree/dev/src/components)
- The API calls are made into split into actions, which you can find in
  [actions](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/tree/dev/src/actions)
- To handle the state for the whole page, we use Redux. You can find the states and reducers in
  [reducers](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/tree/dev/src/reducers)
- [api_client](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/tree/dev/src/api_client) is just a simple Axios
  client
- In [util](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-frontend/tree/dev/src/util) you can find miscellaneous functions.
