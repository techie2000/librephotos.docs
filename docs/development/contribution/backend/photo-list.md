## How React Pig works

- Fetch the number of days with the count of all images with `GET /api/albums/date/list/`.
- Based on the number of photos per day, create a bunch of empty `<div/>` with the attribute `isTemp` and an `aspectRatio=1` which will then be rendered as by react-pig.
- `react-pig` calculates a somewhat accurate height for scrolling based on the number of elements and the `aspectRatio`.
- When scrolling, the `isTemp` element is used to determine, if a currently visible element is actually loaded yet or not. If not, load the missing images with `GET /api/albums/date/4/`
