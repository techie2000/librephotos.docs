## UhuruPhotos

[UhuruPhotos](https://uhuru.photos/) is a native Android client for LibrePhotos, written using the latest Android technologies. It is the most feature complete app for LibrePhotos.

It aims to become a full-featured photo album replacement, including features like offline support, backup and sync etc.

The app is currently in [open beta on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.savvasdalkitsis.uhuruphotos). You can contact [the author](https://github.com/savvasdalkitsis/) on [gitter](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#uhuruphotos:gitter.im) or [discord](https://discord.gg/xwRvtSDGWb) for information.

## LibrePhotos Mobile

[LibrePhotos Mobile](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-mobile) is the official app, which is at the proof-of-concept stage. It's written in react-native and in the future will share more code with the frontend.

You can download the .apk [here](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-mobile/releases/tag/latest). It is technically possible to compile it to also work on iOS, but nobody stepped up to do that yet.
