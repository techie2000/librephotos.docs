## LibrePhotos Mobile

[LibrePhotos Mobile](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-mobile) is the official app, which is at the proof-of-concept stage. It's written in react-native and in the future will share more code with the frontend.

You can download the .apk [here](https://github.com/LibrePhotos/librephotos-mobile/releases/tag/v1.0.3). It is technically possible to compile it to also work on iOS, but nobody stepped up to do that yet.
